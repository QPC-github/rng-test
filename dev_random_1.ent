Entropy = 7.997277 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 65536 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 65536 samples is 247.27, and randomly
would exceed this value 62.40 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5697 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.150338766 (error 0.28 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.005536 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
