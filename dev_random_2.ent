Entropy = 7.997350 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 65536 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 65536 samples is 239.21, and randomly
would exceed this value 75.32 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.7085 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.117011536 (error 0.78 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.008244 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
