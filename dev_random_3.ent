Entropy = 7.997260 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 65536 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 65536 samples is 247.61, and randomly
would exceed this value 61.82 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.3343 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141915400 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000090 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
